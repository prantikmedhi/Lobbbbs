   <p>Nishtha, I love you so muchhhhhhh</p>

<p>I know we have only known each other a short time,</p>

<p>But in just a month, you've become my best best best bestest friend.</p>

<p>Every laugh every late night chat and every small moment we’ve shared means the world to me.</p>

<p>I know you have been through a lot,</p>

<p>And I understand that trusting again isn’t easy,</p>

<p>Especially in a world that doesn’t always value loyalty.</p>

<p>But I’m not here to waste time or hurt you, Nishi.</p>

<p>I want something real and lasting forever –</p>

<p>A relationship built on trust, honesty, and understanding.</p>

<p>I have never felt the kind of happiness I feel with you.</p>

<p>My past relationship never gave me the joy that you bring into my life.</p>

<p>You’re the real happiness I have been searching for,</p>

<p>And I want to build something meaningful with you.</p>

<br />

<p>I promise you, if you’re willing to take this step with me,</p>

<p>I will do my best every day to prove that real love and loyalty still exist.</p>

<p>I want to be someone you can trust completely,</p>

<p>Not just now, but in the future too.</p>

<p>Let’s give this a try pilisssssssssssss – no pressure,</p>

<p>Just us seeing where it goes together😃</p>
